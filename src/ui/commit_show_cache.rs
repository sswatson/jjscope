/*! This module provides a cache of the output from 'jj show'
It is optimized for continous editing, which means that the
automatic rebase that happens when a change is modified will
also empty cache values. It does allow divergent changes, where
several visible commits share the same change id.

The design prevents a single huge commit from eating memory if
an ancester causes it to be rebased without modification lots of time.
